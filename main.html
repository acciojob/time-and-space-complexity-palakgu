	<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a type of computational complexity that describes the time required to execute an algorithm.efficient
		The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes for each statement to complete. As a result, 
		it is highly dependent on the size of the processed data.</p>
	<p> <b>Space Complexity</b> is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity.
		If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n) space. If you build a two-dimensional array of size n*n,
		this will need O(n2) space.
		Space complexity is dependent on several factors.</p>
